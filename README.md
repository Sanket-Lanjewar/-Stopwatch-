# delta2-Demo
This is a domo for git&amp; github project.
A web-based stopwatch application concept, where HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are used to create and manage the functionality of a stopwatch with start, pause, reset, and lap recording features. I can help you break this down step by step for creating such a web application. Here's a general overview of how each technology will be used:
How it works:
Start/Stop: The stopwatch starts or stops when the "Start" button is clicked. It uses setInterval to continuously update the displayed time every second.
Reset: The "Reset" button stops the stopwatch, resets the time to 00:00:00, and clears any recorded lap times.
Lap: The "Lap" button records the current displayed time into a list and displays the laps below the stopwatch.
With this approach, you have a fully functional web-based stopwatch. You can further enhance the application by adding more features such as saving lap times locally or allowing multiple stopwatches.

### Features
Start/Stop: Start or stop the stopwatch by clicking the "Start/Stop" button.

Reset: Resets the stopwatch to 00:00:00 and clears all recorded laps.

Lap: Records the current time as a lap and displays the list of lap times.

Responsive Design: The stopwatch is fully responsive and works well across different devices.

### Technologies Used
HTML: Structures the stopwatch layout and buttons.

CSS: Styles the stopwatch, buttons, and lap list for an aesthetically pleasing and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: Handles the stopwatch's logic, updating time, and recording laps.

## How It Works
#### Start/Stop Functionality:

The "Start" button triggers the setInterval() function to update the displayed time every second.
The "Stop" button pauses the time when clicked.
#### Reset Functionality:

Clicking the "Reset" button stops the stopwatch, clears the interval, resets the displayed time to 00:00:00, and clears any recorded laps.
Lap Functionality:

The "Lap" button records the current time displayed on the stopwatch and adds it to a list below the stopwatch.
